                <div id="namepic" class="block"><p>My name is Kevin. I was born in California and now live with my family in Utah. I am currently
                working as an IT Manager at a construction supply company. I am married and have seven
                children, three of which are now adults. I have mixed feelings about getting older, but hope for the
                best when it comes to my family.</p>

                <p class="block">Utah is located in the United States of America, and became the 45th state in the year 1896. It is
                home to a diversity of religions, though has a large concentration of members of the Church of Jesus
                Christ of Latter-day Saints, which religion's members entered and began seriously settling the area in 1847. It is an area of
                mountains and valleys, and while having plenty of plant and animal life, is largely a desert, suffering
                from droughts more often than not.</p>
