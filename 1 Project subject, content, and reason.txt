Subject: 

The people of the IT Department of Mountainland Supply

Succinctly describe the planned content of the website:

A website that describes aspects of my coworkers, though does so using no clicking, but reveals additional information about subjects with popups as one hovers over images, and other popups. I will be using false images and names to protect the privacy of my coworkers.

The reason you chose this subject:

It is a subject on which I am familiar. I also saw a website that did this once upon a time and would like to create my own version of it.
