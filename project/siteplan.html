        <h2>
            Color Schema
        </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                I am a fan of blues and whites. I especially like navy blue. I like it because when I was growing up,
                the
                best suit to make yourself look impressive was a navy blue pin striped suit. It was hard to compete
                with.
                With that said, styles are now different, but I hold on the color that represents business, military,
                and
                altogether a professional appearance.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            Fonts
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I actually prefer the default fonts of websites. With that said, our assignments usually require that I
                show
                some creativity in this area, so I have used the first recommendation: Roboto. I like the bold straight
                lines of this font, and will be using it throughout this website
            </li>
        </ul>
