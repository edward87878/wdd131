Pretty simple. Add the attribute loading="lazy" to the things you don't want loaded immediately.

<img src="images/anyphoto.jpg" alt="A good description of the non decorative image" loading="lazy" width="300" height="500">

loading="eager" is the other one, and doesn't need to be added since it is the default.

Can use css effects to get the image to fade in
