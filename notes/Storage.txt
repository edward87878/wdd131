Storage
=======

. Can store values and other items as key/pairs in Storage within a browser js program

Storage.length
  Returns number of items stored in the Storage object

Storage.key(n)
  Returns name of nth key in the Storage object

Storage.getItem(key)
  Returns value based on name of key passed

Storage.setItem(key)
  Changes value for given key name, or, if key does not 
  exist, creates new key/value pairing in Storage

Storage.removeItem(key)
  Removes the key value pair for the passed key

Storage.clear()
  Removal all key/value pairs from Storage

===============

Different storage methods:

Cookies
. have about 4 KB of capacity
. Expiration timeframe is manually set
. Accessible from any window

localStorage
. have about 5 MB of capacity
. Never expires
. Accessible from any window

sessionStorage
. have about 5 MB of capacity
. Expires when tab or window closes
. Accessible from same tab

* Each of the above stores data in the client browser, rather than on a server somewhere

================

localStorage better than cookies

- more intuitive
- stores string data in key/value pairs
- data persists without expiring. stays in browser

=================

Notes for using Local Storage

. since stores in strings, need to convert to strings to store, and from strings when retrieving

. Way to do this is the following:

JSON.stringify() ... converts a value to a string
JSON.parse() .. converts back to non-string value
